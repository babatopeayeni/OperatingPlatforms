# The Gaming Room Software Design Document

## Overview
This repository contains the finalized software design document developed for The Gaming Room as part of the CS 230 course. This document showcases my ability to design software solutions effectively and communicate those designs clearly to both clients and team members. Below, I provide a reflection on the project and the process of creating the software design.

### Summary of the Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client focused on developing mobile and web-based games. Their existing game, *Draw It or Lose It*, is an Android-only application, and they wanted a web-based version to expand its accessibility across multiple platforms. Additionally, they sought to replace the manual drawing feature with a library of preloaded images to enhance gameplay and improve user engagement while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

### Strengths in Creating the Documentation
A key strength of my work on this project was the detailed and well-organized presentation of the design. By incorporating UML diagrams, domain models, and thorough explanations, I ensured that the design was accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. This helped to align the development process with the client’s vision and goals.

### Value of the Design Process
Developing the design document provided a clear structure and roadmap for the coding phase. It allowed all team members to fully understand the architecture, system components, and their relationships, reducing ambiguity during development. This alignment ensured that the project stayed on track and met the client’s requirements effectively.

### Potential Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one aspect of the design document, I would enhance the section covering security. While it addressed basic protections like encryption and role-based access, I would expand it to include specific examples of potential risks and strategies to mitigate them. This would make the document more robust and comprehensive.

### Understanding and Addressing User Needs
Interpreting user needs and integrating them into the software design was a fundamental part of this project. By crafting user stories and translating them into actionable requirements, I ensured the design focused on the end user’s experience. For example, introducing a stock image library directly addressed the user feedback for smoother and more engaging gameplay. Keeping user needs at the forefront is essential to creating software that delivers value and meets expectations.

### Software Design Approach
My approach to software design was iterative and involved continuous collaboration. Techniques such as creating UML diagrams, breaking down the system into manageable components, and maintaining open communication with the client helped ensure that the design remained aligned with project goals. In the future, I plan to incorporate more Agile methodologies, such as iterative feedback loops and continuous updates, to further enhance flexibility and responsiveness in design.

## Conclusion
This project highlighted the importance of thorough documentation in guiding software development. The design document not only served as a blueprint for the technical team but also facilitated clear communication with the client. Reflecting on this experience, I have identified strategies for improvement and future application, reinforcing my skills as a software designer.
